                        This artifact provides armor penetration to the entire team <br>
                        This artifact needs to receive magic attacks to be charged. <br>
                        Magic attacks come from osh spheres. <br>
						if armor penetration is too high or at the wrong level, <br>
						Other heroes, such as Cornelius, will not be able to do the right amount of damage to OSH.
						<br> in May 2025 the optimal value for this artifact is 114 .
						<br> Increasing it beyond this level can make things worse.
						<br> However up to level 118-120 in many cases it does not cause problems.

                        <br> This is a disadvantage because it increases the risk of destroying his recharge spheres early.
						<br> It is even worse than the first artifact
                        <br> Since it does not offer any stats to other heroes.
